# React Lifestyle
React is used to visualize components. Methods that are used are called lifecycles and can be used to update UI and app status. There are three stages to a lifecycle:
- Mounting 
- Updating
- Unmounting
 ### Mounting 
 The intial phase of when a component is created is called mounting. This occurs once the component is attached to the DOM. We have covered the function of rendering which is a part of the mounting lifecycle. 

 ### Updating 
 Updating is self explained. Whenever a component is updated in goes through the updating lifecycle. 

 ### Unmounting 
 This is the final stage. This occurs when a component is removed from the DOM. 

 There are several different commands used to trigger the lifecylce phases. I made a note of are use of render but some others that will be handy in the future include constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, componenetDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate, getSnapShotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate and componenetWillUnmount. 
 
## Questions on reading
 1) render
 2) constructor
 3) The order:
 - constructor
 - render
 - componentDidMount
 - componentWillUnmount
 React updates should be preformed before using React 
 4) Used right after a component is mounted. If anything is needed to be loaded using a network request it will be done at componentDidMount

 ## Video Questions
1) Titles, subtitles, anything that will be needed to run a function 
2) Props are passed into componenets while states are handled within a componenet
3) Re rendering occurs when a state is changed within a componenet
4) State is used when we need to re render or change an application 

 ## Things I want to know more about
 I have seen a lot of topics on linked lists. I know from my own studies on interview questions, they are a favorite topic of interviewers. I will read more about Floyds algorthim for Cycle detection.
