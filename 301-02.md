# React Lifestyle
React is used to visualize components. Methods that are used are called lifecycles and can be used to update UI and app status. There are three stages to a lifecycle:
- Mounting 
- Updating
- Unmounting
 ### Mounting 
 The intial phase of when a component is created is called mounting. This occurs once the component is attached to the DOM. We have covered the function of rendering which is a part of the mounting lifecycle. 

 ### Updating 
 Updating is self explained. Whenever a component is updated in goes through the updating lifecycle. 

 ### Unmounting 
 This is the final stage. This occurs when a component is removed from the DOM. 

 There are several different commands used to trigger the lifecylce phases. I made a note of are use of render but some others that will be handy in the future include constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, componenetDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate, getSnapShotBeforeUpdate, componentDidUpdate and componenetWillUnmount.
