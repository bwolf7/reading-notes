# Reading Notes 1
## What is Markup?
Markdown is used as a simple way to style your webpage. We use markdown in Github but can be used in VScode as well. Markdown uses special characters to control the style of text, including headers, emphasis, lists both unordered and ordered, quotes, inclined code, and the ability to add images and hyperlinks. Files are saved with the .md suffix. 

## What are Github Pages?
Lets us easily turn Github Repos into websites to display all of our fantasy work in a simple format. Github pages host the site for you through Github. You don't need to worry about host fees or configuring a DNS. It's all done on the backend so no HTML knowledge is required. You are able to link several Github projects in the same repo by calling them from your host document. That means several pages can be added to your site. 

## Sum it up
My little knowledge of code, Markup is by the simplest one out there, at least on the surface layer. We were able to make a basic page displaying who we are and some interests. No VScode was required because it was all through Github. It's a great way to spice up our profiles and give them our own signature flair.
