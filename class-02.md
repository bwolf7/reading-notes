# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS
## What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used with HTML to make the structure of the site "pretty". CSS allows you to customize the color of text, the background design and even add some borders to spruce up your site. Implementing CSS into your HTML can be done in 3 diverse ways. External, when the code is saved in its own file then merged with HTML. This choice is best if you want to keep all your languages separate for troubleshooting. Internal, when the CSS and HTML code are kept on the same file. This choice is best if you want the structure and design together for each individual page. And lastly is Inline. This is when CSS is implemented into the HTML code. This choice is best for designing each element.

## JS Basics and Loops
Programming in JS can be done using expressions and operators. Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks to JS. Think of a function like an IKEA setup instruction. A set of steps to produce a reliable product based off the builder. Functions can be defined in many ways.  

` function clickable(){ ` 

` $("#HTMLid).onClick("action to be taken"); ` 

` } ` 

This is an example of a clickable button function. This code by its self, will do nothing without some other elements. I liked this aa an example of how something so simple for the user to interact with, requires some work on the back end. Functions are invoked with `(). You can invoke a function in a HTML file if the JS file with your function is referenced in the HTML file.  

# What are loops?
Loops are an easy way to preform something repeatley. Loops are thought of as a didigtal treasure map, telling how to get to and where to look. 
## What is a for loop?
For used are used when you know how many times the code needs to activate. 
## What is a while loop?
While loops are used when the user dosent know how many times the loop needs to run. While loops are practical for when there can be multiple answers but need to set a criteria.
