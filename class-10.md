# JS Debugging
Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors. Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose. Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors. Searching for errors in programming code is called code debugging. Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user. With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints. In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. The `debugger` keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls the debugging function. This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger. If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect.
