# REST 
## Who is Roy Fielding?
He helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet. 
## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
Because a webpage representation might not have the content or resources you may be looking for and instead of finding them for you, it will redirect you to the page where the resources could be at. 

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
HTTP is the protocal that the browser will use. The second part to a url is the map or location where to go. HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns.

## What does a GET do?
GET is used to retrieve information. Just like you would GET a cup.

## What does a POST do?
POST is used when a system needs to add something to another system.

## What does PUT do?
PUT is used when a system wants to replace something on another system.

## What does PATCH do?
PATCH is used to partially update a system.
