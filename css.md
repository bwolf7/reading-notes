# CSS Reading Notes
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used with HTML to make the structure of the site "pretty". CSS allows you to customize the color of text, the background design and even add some borders to spruce up your site. Implementing CSS into your HTML can be done in 3 diverse ways. External, when the code is saved in its own file then merged with HTML. This choice is best if you want to keep all your languages separate for troubleshooting. Internal, when the CSS and HTML code are kept on the same file. This choice is best if you want the structure and design together for each individual page. And lastly is Inline. This is when CSS is implemented into the HTML code. This choice is best for designing each element.
