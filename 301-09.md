# Functional Programming 
## What is functional programming?
Functional programming isa paradigm that treats computation as thethe evaluation of math functions and avoids changing state.

## What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
It returns the same result if given the same arguments and It does not cause any observable side effects.

## What are the benefits of a pure function?
Allows for several callbacks becasue of its built in parameters instead of relying on global variables. This allows the code to be easier to test.

## What is immutability?
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.

## What is Referential transparency?
When a pure function and immutable data are combinde.

# Video Notes
## What is a module?
Allows code to be called upon when needed by splitting them into single modules. Like componets. 

## What does the word ‘require’ do?
Allows other files to use the code within the required file. Like import.

## How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
var "test" = require (/"file name") - In parent
module.export = "test" -In child

## What do we have to do to make a module available?
By exporting from the file you want to use and requiring in the file you want to use it on
