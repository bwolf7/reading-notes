# JS Object Literals; The DOM
## JS Object Literals
In plain English, an object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs inside of curly braces. Those values can be properties and functions. All members of an object literal in JavaScript, both properties and functions, are public. The only place you can put private members is inside of a function. You cannot copy an object literal without manually copying all the values. Object literal should be used if you want to create objects on the go with no intention of copying values to another object or maybe mapping one object to another.
## The DOM
The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page. A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
