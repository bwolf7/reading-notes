# HTML Tables; JS Constructor Functions
## HTML Tables
HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns. Each table cell is defined by a `<td>` and a `</td>` tag. td stands for table data. Everything between `<td>` and `</td>` are the content of the table cell. Each table row starts with a `<tr>` and end with a `</tr>` tag. `tr` stands for table row. You can have as many rows as you like in a table, just make sure that the number of cells are the same in each row. Sometimes you want your cells to be headers, in those cases use the `<th>` tag instead of the `<td>` tag

## JS Constructor Functions
In JavaScript, a constructor function is used to create objects. To create an object from a constructor function, we use the `new` keyword. In JavaScript, you can create multiple objects from a constructor function. In JavaScript, when `this` keyword is used in a constructor function, `this` refers to the object when the object is created. You can also create a constructor function with parameters. Object Literal is generally used to create a single object. The constructor function is useful if you want to create multiple objects. Each object created from the constructor function is unique. You can have the same properties as the constructor function or add a new property to one particular object. However, if an object is created with an object literal, and if a variable is defined with that object value, any changes in variable value will change the original object.
