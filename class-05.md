# HTML Images; CSS Color & Text
## HTML Images
Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page. The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page. In the <img> tage you can call a http or https source using the `src` command. This allows for any img or media found on the www to be used on your webpage. When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. Additonally there is an `alt` attribute. The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it. If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute.

## CSS Color & Text
CSS has a lot of properties for formatting text. The color property can be used to set the color of the text.
Colors can be set 3 ways:
- a color name - like "red"
- a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
- an RGB value - like "rgb(255,0,0)"
Colors can also be used to set the background color using `background-color` in the body tag.
