# Intro to HTML & JS
## HTML
What is HTML? HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to make the structure of a website. HTML consists of opening and closing tags, Aswell as the content needed for the website and the elements. Within elements, we can nest other elements. Like Markdown, we can emphasize characters to be bold or italic. Images can be nested into *empty elements** if they already have an HTML page. Sematic elements are commonly used elements in HTML. There are close to 100 semantic elements, allowing you to customize your webpage from the Header to the Footer. 
## JS
### What is JavaScript? 

JavaScript is the most well-known scripting language. JavaScript is a scripting language that allows users to bring complex features on their website. JS lets you edit multiple web pages with the help of Node and React. Being a dynamic language means the site will do more than sit there and be boring and static. It allows users to have 3D animations to text and images. It is designed to work with our structure HTML and our design CSS.
