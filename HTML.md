# HTML
What is HTML? HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to make the structure of a website. HTML consists of opening and closing tags, Aswell as the content needed for the website and the elements. Within elements, we can nest other elements. Like Markdown, we can emphasize characters to be bold or italic. Images can be nested into *empty elements** if they already have an HTML page. Sematic elements are commonly used elements in HTML. There are close to 100 semantic elements, allowing you to customize your webpage from the Header to the Footer.
