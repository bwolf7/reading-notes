# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model
## HTML Lists
- Ordered lists - Start with the <ol> Tag and display a number next to the listed item.
- Unordered list - Start with the <ul> tag and display a bullet or - next to the listed item. 
- Listed items- Use the <li> tag and display information as the list.

## CSS Boxes
In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
- Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
- Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
- Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

## JS Control Flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. In an asynchronous laungauge like JavaScript, code is run from the first line to the last line in order. Conditions and loops are structures used to change the control flow. For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in.
