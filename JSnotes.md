# JS Notes 

## What is JavaScript? 

JavaScript is the most well-known scripting language. JavaScript is a scripting language that allows users to bring complex features on their website. JS lets you edit multiple web pages with the help of Node and React. Being a dynamic language means the site will do more than sit there and be boring and static. It allows users to have 3D animations to text and images. It is designed to work with our structure HTML and our design CSS.  

 
 

## What can JavaScript do? 

JS allows users to store values in variables. These can range from simple but true strings like ` var brandonIsCool= true`. More advanced methods include event handlers which control how clients will interact with the site to multimedia management. JS also can interact with backend software like Rest API's. That means the site can store and authenticate users and passwords using 3rd party Postman. Think of it as the equivalent of a coded Active Directory. We can also include Nav bars on our sites to allow easy navigation through the site on the front end.
