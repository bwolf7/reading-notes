# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions
## HTML Links
Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page. A link has two ends, called anchors. They are shown as <a> tags. The link starts at the source anchor and points to the destination anchor. Links can be websites, PDfs, Videos and other media sources. 

## CSS Layout
CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they're positioned relative to the following factors: their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, and the main viewport.
Some of the CSS layouts are:
- Normal flow
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Floats
- Positioning
- Table layout
- multiple-cloumn layout

## JS Functions
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets {}. Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
