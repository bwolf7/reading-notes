# Programming with JavaScript 

Programming in JS can be done using expressions and operators. Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks to JS. Think of a function like an IKEA setup instruction. A set of steps to produce a reliable product based off the builder. Functions can be defined in many ways.  

` function clickable(){ ` 

` $("#HTMLid).onClick("action to be taken"); ` 

` } ` 

This is an example of a clickable button function. This code by its self, will do nothing without some other elements. I liked this aa an example of how something so simple for the user to interact with, requires some work on the back end. Functions are invoked with `(). You can invoke a function in a HTML file if the JS file with your function is referenced in the HTML file.
