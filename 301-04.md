# React and forms
## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
A controlled componenet is input form element whose value is controlled by React that keeps its state until influenced by a user input like a form. 
## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why?
Updating the state will allow the user to have validation as they are typing. Using a controlled input keep in syhc with the inputs value.


## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
The target will fire when a user changes the value of an input, select or textarea element.
## Why would we use a ternary operator?
Les typing is required and that is always a plus. But it also lets us set multiple conditions in a single line of code. 
## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement
`let x.y = x === y ? "true" : "false"`
