# Intro 

Hello world,
My name is Brandon Wolf. I am 25 years old living in Newport Beach, CA. I am a Navy veteran with 5 years of service as an Aviation Electronics Technician. I was stationed in Virginia Beach, Va for all 5 years where I saw one deployment on the USS Harry S. Truman. I left active duty to pursue a career in tech while I continue my duties as an IT1 in the naval reserves. I attended Microsoft Software and Systems Academy when first transitioning out where I grew a fascination with the Cloud and its vast usages, specifically with Azure's ability to adapt to new technologies like Blockchain and AI.
