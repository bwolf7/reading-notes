## What is a Text Editor?
A text editor is self-explanatory, it edits text. If you are as bad as a spller as I am, you know autocorrect is a life saver. But in the coding word a text editor can be more than that, in fact it should be more than that. A good text editor should be able to complete your code, highlight syntax errors, have a selection of themes, and have a wide variety of extensions to make your coding life easier. Some of the best products I have used are Notepad++. From the days of hosting a simple Minecraft server on my old 2004 HP desktop, this was necessary. You can quickly change the values of Boleens and exponents to customize your world and how the server will act. Notepad++ is extremely easy to use if you are a Windows OS user. However, as I got older and needed to produce full lines of code, I swapped to VS Code. VS code comes in a default dark theme, and if you are staring at a computer screen long enough, you know this may be the only thing that matters. On top of that, VS code allows for easy integration of thousands of extensions and themes that being easily downloaded. VS code offers a broad range of languages and with implantation of react, you will have a website up and running while being appealing to the eye in no time.
