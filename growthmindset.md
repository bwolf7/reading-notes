# Growth Mindset 

## What is Growth Mindset? 

Growth mindset in my own is the **will** to want to learn. Everyone says they *want* to learn something or do something, but the **will** is what gets it done. Overcoming the challenges and roadblocks in your way is part of the journey that is learning. 

 
 

### How to follow 

- Embrace the suck because it will suck at some points.  

- Its ok not to get it the first time. Slowing down and asking for help is allowed. 

- Celebrate your success. You deserve it!
