# Putting it all together 

## Thinking in React 
### What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
The single responibillity principle is that a componenet should do only one thing. If you want  that component to do more than one thing, it should be broken down and recomposed. 

### What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
Th first rule of building static apps is to not use state. Static apps requring a lot of typing but not mush thinking. Static apps have no intereactivity, think of a static footer or an image group. 

### Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
A reusable library of reusable components

### What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
Is there a component that renders something based on state?
Does the parent own state?
Does the component input props?

### How can you identify where state needs to live?
If the component needs to render something based off state

## Higher-Order Functions 

### What is a “higher-order function”?
Functions that operate on other functions, wither by taking them as arguments or by returning them. 

### Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?
Returning the value m when it is greater than value n

### Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.
map can be used in a child component to take a higer function and remap it to an array on a lower level.
